Observer Design Pattern in Android (MVVM Example)
The Observer Design Pattern allows objects (observers) to subscribe and react to changes in another object (the subject).
This decouples components and ensures that when the subject's data updates, all subscribed observers are automatically notified and updated.

Real-World Example in Android (MVVM):

Subject: In the MVVM architecture, a ViewModel holds data using LiveData.
Observers: Activities or Fragments subscribe to this LiveData to get notified of any changes.
Benefit: When data (e.g., user information) changes—such as after a network call—the UI automatically updates without the need for manual intervention.
Sample Flow:

ViewModel fetches and updates data in a MutableLiveData object.
Activity/Fragment observes the LiveData and refreshes the UI when notified of changes.
This implementation exemplifies how the Observer pattern promotes loose coupling, responsiveness, and a clean code structure in Android applications.
